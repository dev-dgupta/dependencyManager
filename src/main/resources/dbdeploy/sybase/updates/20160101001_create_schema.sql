How to name upgrade scripts?

- Upgrade scripts must start with a number. The format <date><incremental>_<script description>.sql is a good example.

- we have used the pattern, yyyyMMddnnn_<script description> where yyyyMMdd represents the date, nnn is a running sequence number 
  of scripts with the same date. Always sequence number starts as 001 on a given date. 
  If more than one script is created with the same date, then it goes as 001, 002, 003 â€¦ and so on.

NOTE IF YOU DON'T NEED DATABASE
- remove the 'dbdeploy_scripts' folder under '<project root dir>/src/main/resources/ion-installer'
